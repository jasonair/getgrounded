    <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
    <p>
      When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the
      age of 13, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete,
      and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information

    <h2>2. Service Functionality</h2>

      Grounded. provides a service to help users track sustainable habits (such

      from your device (e.g., location services) and potentially connected
      third-party services. While we strive for accuracy, we cannot guarantee
      the perfect precision of tracked data or point calculations. Factors like
      device settings, GPS availability, and API limitations can affect
      accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>

      partner participation are subject to change without notice. We are not
