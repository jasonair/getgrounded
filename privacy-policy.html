  <h1>Privacy Policy for Grounded.</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: April 5, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how
    <b>Grounded</b> (“Grounded”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, shares,
    and protects personal information when you use our website
    (https://getgrounded.io) and related services (collectively, the “Services”).
    It also describes your rights regarding your personal data and how you can
    exercise those rights. We are committed to processing your personal data in
    accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
  </p>

  <p>
    By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of your
    information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with
    our practices, please do not use the website or Services.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>We may collect various types of information from you, which can include:</p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li>
      <b>Personal Information You Provide:</b> Information you voluntarily
      provide to us through forms or interactions on our site. For example,
      when you subscribe to a newsletter, request information, or contact us,
      we may collect identifiers like your name, email address, phone number,
      or other contact details. We will also collect any messages or content
      you provide when you communicate with us (such as support inquiries or
      feedback).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Usage Data:</b> Information automatically collected about your use of
      our website. This includes technical data such as your IP address,
      browser type, device type, operating system, referring URLs, pages
      viewed, and the dates/times of your visits. We also gather information on
      how you interact with our site, which helps us understand usage patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</b> We use cookies and similar
      tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to enhance your
      experience. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that allow
      us to recognize you on subsequent visits, remember your preferences, and
      analyze website traffic. You can control or disable cookies through your
      browser settings; however, note that some features of our site might not
      function properly if cookies are disabled. For more details, please see
      our Cookies notice (if available).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We limit the personal information we collect to what is necessary for the
    purposes set out in this policy. Where feasible, we may anonymize or
    aggregate data so that it does not identify you personally.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li>
      <b>To Provide and Maintain Services:</b> We process your personal
      information to operate the website and provide you with the features and
      services you request. For example, if you sign up for an account or
      newsletter, we use your email to send confirmations or updates. We also
      use personal data to respond to your inquiries, support requests, or
      feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>To Improve and Personalize Services:</b> We use usage data and
      analytics to understand how users interact with our Services and to
      improve the content and functionality of our site. This helps us
      troubleshoot issues, perform data analysis, test new features, and
      enhance user experience. It is in our legitimate interest to analyze and
      improve our Services for our users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Communication:</b> We may use your contact information to send you
      administrative messages (such as service notifications, technical or
      security notices). With your consent, we may also send you promotional
      communications such as newsletters, special offers, or updates about new
      features. You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking
      the unsubscribe link in those emails or contacting us.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Legal Compliance and Security:</b> We may process personal data as
      required to comply with applicable legal obligations, such as financial
      reporting requirements or responding to lawful requests by public
      authorities. We also use data to enforce our Terms and Conditions,
      prevent fraud or other illegal activities, and protect the rights,
      property, and safety of Grounded, our users, or others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Other Purposes with Consent:</b> If we intend to use your information
      for a purpose that is not outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will
      explain that purpose at the time and, if required, obtain your consent.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom,
    we rely on the following legal grounds under the GDPR for processing your
    personal data:
  </p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li>
      <b>Consent:</b> For certain types of processing, we will seek your
      consent. For example, we will obtain your consent to send you marketing
      emails or to place non-essential cookies. You have the right to withdraw
      your consent at any time, which will not affect the lawfulness of
      processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Performance of a Contract:</b> We process personal data to perform
      our contractual obligations to you. For instance, when you sign up for an
      account or request a service, we need to use your information to provide
      those services (or to take steps at your request before entering into a
      contract).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Legitimate Interests:</b> We process data as necessary for our
      legitimate interests, provided those are not overridden by your data
      protection rights. Our legitimate interests may include improving and
      securing our Services, communicating with you about our Services, and
      understanding how users interact with our website. When we rely on
      legitimate interests, we consider and balance any potential impact on you
      and your rights.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Legal Obligation:</b> In some cases, we need to process personal data
      to comply with a legal obligation, such as maintaining proper business
      records, handling law enforcement requests, or complying with regulatory
      requirements.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h2>

  <p>
    We do <b>not</b> sell or rent your personal information. We only share your
    information in the following circumstances:
  </p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li>
      <b>Service Providers:</b> We may share data with third-party companies
      and individuals that provide services on our behalf, such as website
      hosting, data analytics, email delivery, customer support, or other
      operational services. These service providers will access your
      information only to perform tasks for us and are obligated not to
      disclose or use it for other purposes. We ensure that any processors
      handling your data do so in compliance with applicable data protection
      laws and subject to contractual obligations to safeguard your information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Legal Requirements:</b> We may disclose your information if required
      to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests by public
      authorities (for example, a court order, subpoena, or government demand)
      . We may also disclose personal information if we believe in good faith
      that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation,
      (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) prevent or
      investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services, or (iv)
      protect the personal safety of users or the public.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Business Transfers:</b> If Grounded is involved in a merger,
      acquisition, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or reorganization, your
      personal information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as
      part of that transaction. In such cases, we will ensure your data
      remains subject to confidentiality obligations and will provide notice
      before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a
      different privacy policy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>With Your Consent:</b> We will share your personal information with
      third parties outside of the above circumstances only with your consent.
      For example, if you agree to let us share your details with a partner
      for their own marketing, we will do so only with your explicit consent,
      and you are free to revoke such consent at any time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  <p>
    Grounded is based in a jurisdiction that may not have equivalent data
    protection laws as your home country. If you are accessing our Services
    from the EEA, UK, or other regions with laws governing data collection and
    use, please note that your personal information <b>may be transferred to,
      and processed in, countries outside of your home jurisdiction</b>. In
    particular, our website servers or service providers may be located in
    countries such as the United States or other jurisdictions that do not
    provide the same level of data protection as the laws in your country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whenever we transfer personal data out of the EEA/UK, we take steps to
    ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information. For
    example, we may use the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses
    (SCCs) or other approved mechanisms to ensure that your personal data is
    afforded an adequate level of protection . We may also rely on an EU
    adequacy decision (where the destination country is recognized as having
    adequate data protection) or obtain your explicit consent for specific
    transfers.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using our Services or submitting your information, you consent to this
    transfer, storage, and processing of your information in countries outside
    of your own. We will take all measures reasonably necessary to ensure that
    your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>

  <p>
    We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the
    purposes for which we collected it, including for business or legal
    purposes. Specifically:
  </p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li>
      <b>Personal Data:</b> We will keep your personal information (such as
      your account or contact details) for as long as you have an account or
      active relationship with us. If you close your account or withdraw your
      consent (where applicable), we will delete or anonymize your personal
      data within a reasonable period after the end of our relationship, unless
      a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example,
      for legal compliance, tax, or accounting reasons).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Usage Data:</b> We generally retain usage data for a shorter period
      of time for internal analysis. Usage data (analytics logs, server logs)
      may be kept for a period (e.g., 90 days up to a few years) as needed for
      purposes such as improving the Services and strengthening security. If we
      are required by law or legitimate business need to retain usage data for
      a longer period (for instance, to investigate fraud or troubleshoot
      issues), we will do so in a secure manner.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once the applicable retention period expires, or if you request deletion of
    your data, we will either delete your personal information or anonymize it
    so it can no longer be associated with you. If immediate deletion is not
    possible (for example, because the data is stored in backup archives), we
    will securely store the data and isolate it from further processing until
    deletion is feasible .
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>

  <p>
    If you are in the EEA, UK, or certain other jurisdictions, you have legal
    rights with respect to your personal data. Subject to applicable law and
    certain exceptions, these rights may include:
  </p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li>
      <b>Right of Access:</b> You have the right to request confirmation of
      whether we are processing your personal data, and if so, to request a
      copy of the data we hold about you, as well as supplementary information
      about how that data is used .
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Right of Rectification:</b> You have the right to ask that we correct
      or update any inaccurate or incomplete personal information we hold about
      you. We will rectify such data without undue delay.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Right to Erasure:</b> You have the right to request deletion of your
      personal data in certain circumstances. This right, also known as the
      “right to be forgotten,” applies, for example, if the data is no longer
      necessary for the purposes it was collected, you withdraw consent (where
      the processing was based on consent), or you object to processing and we
      have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue. Please note that we
      may need to retain certain information as required by law or for
      legitimate business purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Right to Restrict Processing:</b> You have the right to request that
      we limit the processing of your personal data in certain situations – for
      instance, if you contest the accuracy of the data, or if the processing
      is unlawful and you prefer restriction over deletion. When processing is
      restricted, we will still store your information but will not use it
      further until the restriction is lifted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Right to Data Portability:</b> You have the right to obtain your
      personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly
      used, and machine-readable format, and to have that data transmitted to
      another data controller where technically feasible. This right applies
      when the processing is based on your consent or a contract and is
      carried out by automated means .
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Right to Object:</b> You have the right to object to our processing
      of your personal data when that processing is based on legitimate
      interests, including profiling based on legitimate interests. If you
      make such an objection, we will evaluate whether our legitimate grounds
      for processing outweigh your privacy rights and if not, we will cease the
      processing in question. You also have an unconditional right to object to
      the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, which
      we will always honor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Right Not to be Subject to Automated Decisions:</b> You have the right
      not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing
      (including profiling) that produces legal effects or similarly
      significant effects for you, unless it is necessary for entering into or
      performing a contract, is authorized by law, or you have given your
      explicit consent. Grounded does not currently engage in solely automated
      decision-making that has legal or significant effects on individuals.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
    <b><a href="mailto:info@grounded.io" target="_blank">info@grounded.io</a></b> with your request. We may ask you to
    verify your
    identity before fulfilling the request (to protect your privacy and
    security). We will respond to your request within the timeframes required
    by applicable law (typically within one month for GDPR-related requests,
    with the possibility of an extension if the request is complex).
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that some rights may be limited under local law. For example,
    we might not be able to delete certain data if we are required to keep it
    by law, or we may refuse to comply with a request if it is manifestly
    unfounded or excessive. If we decline your request, we will explain the
    reasons, subject to any legal or regulatory limitations.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you believe that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR
    or other applicable privacy laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint
    with a supervisory data protection authority. If you are in the EEA, you
    can find contact details for your local authority here:
    https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en. If you are in the UK,
    you can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). We would,
    however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns directly before you
    approach a regulator, so please consider contacting us first.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>

  <p>
    <b>Our website and Services are not intended for individuals under 18 years
      of age.</b> We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone
    under the age of 18 . If you are under 18, please do not use the Services
    or provide any information to us. If we become aware that we have
    inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 18 without
    verifiable parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete such
    information.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under 18
    has provided us with personal information, please contact us at
    <b><a href="mailto:info@grounded.io" target="_blank">info@grounded.io</a></b>. We will promptly investigate and
    remove the
    information from our records if it exists, and take any other necessary
    steps to protect the child’s privacy.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    We take the security of your personal information seriously. Grounded
    implements a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect
    your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
    These measures include encryption of data in transit (via SSL/TLS),
    firewalls, secure server environments, and access controls to personal
    data. We also limit access to your personal data to those employees,
    contractors, and service providers who need to know that information to
    operate or improve our Services.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
    personal information, <b>no method of transmission over the Internet or
      method of electronic storage is 100% secure</b>. Therefore, we cannot
    guarantee absolute security of your data. You transmit information to us at
    your own risk, and are responsible for protecting any passwords or other
    account credentials in your possession. In the event of a data breach, we
    will notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by law.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Please note:</b> If you ever suspect a vulnerability or security
    incident involving Grounded, or have questions about the security of your
    data, please contact us immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
    our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When
    we update the policy, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top.
    If changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as
    on our homepage or via email notification, if appropriate). We encourage
    you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how
    we are protecting the personal information we collect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your continued use of the website or Services after any changes to this
    Privacy Policy have been posted will signify your acknowledgment of the
    modifications and your agreement to abide by the updated policy. If you do
    not agree with any updates or changes, you should stop using the Services
    and, if necessary, delete your account or personal data as provided above.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy
    Policy or how we handle your personal data, please contact us at:
  </p>

  <ul class="terms-list">
    <li><b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto:info@grounded.io" target="_blank">info@grounded.io</a></li>

  <p>
    We will do our best to address your inquiry and resolve any concerns. If
    you are contacting us to exercise a legal privacy right, please clearly
    describe your request and provide any information that will help us to
    verify your identity and locate your data (for example, the email address
    associated with your account).

    Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. Your privacy and trust are
    important to Grounded, and we are committed to safeguarding the personal
    information that you share with us.
